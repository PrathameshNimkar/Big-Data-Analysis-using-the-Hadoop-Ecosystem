# <b>Big Data Analysis using the Hadoop Ecosystem</b>
Learn and implement the Hadoop Ecosystem to drive Big Data Analytics.

I've created a set of tutorials for you to begin your journey into the Big Data world.
If you're new to data engineering within the Hadoop Ecosystem, you've come to the right place!

The above image is the pipeline I'll be using/following for my upcoming tutorials on Big Data analytics using the Hadoop Ecosystem. To begin with, letâ€™s learn about the architectures of each individual system/tool.

We'll build upon this knowledge by implementing a practical real-life project within the aviation domain. Now, for reference, I know very little about this domain, so this should be an interesting challenge to tackle not just for you but for me as well. I'm super excited, hope you are as well...

If you're new to Big Data, I highly recommend to go through the below (in order). So, without further delay, let's begin...
